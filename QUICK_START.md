# ⚡ Budget History Feature - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Implemented

**Feature:** Individual transaction history for ads budget management  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to use  
**Impact:** Every budget addition and spend update is now tracked as a separate entry

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Verify Installation
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/diditrinjano/Documents/DIDIT FILE/ASSIST/NEO-ASSIST/lead-management"

# Check database is updated
npx prisma studio

# You should see:
# ✅ ads_budget table with new columns:
#    - budgetHistory (JSON)
#    - spentHistory (JSON)
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev

# Server running at: http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test the Feature

#### Option A: Manual Testing (Recommended)
1. Go to **Ads Spend** page
2. Click **"Lihat Detail"** on any campaign
3. Look for **"Riwayat Tambah Budget"** tab (History Budget Additions)
4. Look for **"Riwayat Update Spent"** tab (History Spend Updates)
5. Both should show transaction entries with:
   - Amount (green for budget, red for spend)
   - Description/Note
   - Date and Time
   - User who made the transaction

#### Option B: Automated Testing
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x test-budget-history.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
./test-budget-history.sh
```

## 📝 Using the Feature

### Adding Budget

**UI Method:**
1. Go to **Ads Spend** page
2. Find a campaign in the table
3. Click **"Tambah Budget"** button
4. Enter amount (e.g., 5,000,000)
5. Click **"Submit"**
6. ✅ Budget added + history recorded automatically

**What happens behind the scenes:**
```
Your input (5,000,000)
    ↓
API receives POST request
    ↓
System records transaction:
  - type: "budget"
  - amount: 5,000,000
  - note: "Initial budget created" (or adjustment note if updating)
  - user: Your username
  - timestamp: Now
    ↓
✅ Done! Check Detail modal to see new entry
```

### Viewing Transaction History

**UI Method:**
1. Go to **Ads Spend** page
2. Find campaign in table
3. Click **"Lihat Detail"** button
4. In modal, check two tabs:
   - **"Riwayat Tambah Budget"** (Budget additions)
   - **"Riwayat Update Spent"** (Spend updates)

**What you'll see:**
- Each transaction as a separate card
- Amount (green + for budget, red - for spend)
- Description of what changed
- Exact date/time with minutes and seconds
- Name of person who made the change
- Sorted with newest entries at the top

## 🔍 How Transaction Recording Works

### When You Add Budget
```
Before:  budget = 5,000,000
Action:  Add 2,500,000 more
After:   budget = 7,500,000

History Entry Created:
  type: "budget"
  amount: 2,500,000    ← The CHANGE amount
  note: "Budget adjustment from 5000000 to 7500000"
  
Result: History shows +2,500,000 (the addition)
        Not 7,500,000 (which would be cumulative)
```

### When You Record Spend
```
Before:  spent = 1,000,000
Action:  Spend 1,500,000 more
After:   spent = 2,500,000

History Entry Created:
  type: "spend"
  amount: 1,500,000    ← The CHANGE amount
  note: "Spend update from 1000000 to 2500000"
  
Result: History shows -1,500,000 (the increase)
        Not 2,500,000 (which would be cumulative)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: History not showing
**Solution:**
1. Refresh the page (Cmd+R on Mac)
2. Check browser console for errors (Cmd+Option+J)
3. Verify API is responding: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/ads-spend`

### Issue: Old entries from before update
**Solution:**
- This is expected - entries without dates are old
- New entries will have proper timestamps

### Issue: Amount seems wrong
**Solution:**
- Remember: History shows the CHANGE amount, not cumulative
- If it says +2.5M, that's the addition to previous amount

### Issue: Can't see Detail modal
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're on the Ads Spend page
2. Scroll table if campaign not visible
3. Click "Lihat Detail" button on any row

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check if feature is working

**Via UI:**
1. Add a budget
2. Immediately go to Detail modal
3. Should see entry in history within 1 second

**Via API:**
```bash
# Get budget history
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ads-budget-history?adsBudgetId=1 | jq '.data | length'

# Should return a number (count of entries)
# If returns empty array [], check if budget exists
```
